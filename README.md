Predict fish weight using fish dimensions

In this project I used fish dimensions data set that can found in that link: https://www.kaggle.com/aungpyaeap/fish-market
I built a gradient descent prediction model to predict the fish weight given its dimensions. Then I built a flask application for the model and made a web page for the prediction UI using HTML and CSS, the web page was then made accessible using Heroku interface.
To run the application, you can simply go to that link: 
https://lab4-fish-weight.herokuapp.com/  and put the fish dimensions.
and to run your own version, you can copy the files from the git repo, then make your modifications, then re-deploy it in Heroku and generate your own link.
Files to modify:
1-weight model.py to modify the prediction model. 
2-FlaskApp.py to modify the flask app. 
3-template/index.html to modify the HTML file and structure of the page. 
4-static/css/style.css to modify the page appearances.
